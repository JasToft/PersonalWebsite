Here's my personal portfolio website! I made it from scratch while watching the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YFrGy_mzjY. I then used the skills I learned
in the video to create more pages for the website (like the projects and experiences) on my own. I also changed features like the background and colour scheme to make it 
more personalized. I really enjoyed web development and I will continue to add more projects to the page. It's a great way to show off my skills and to have fun being creative.
